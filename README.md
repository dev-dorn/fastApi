- **Robust Data Validation**: Employs Marshmallow schemas to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Flexible Querying**: Supports filtering of schedules based on status, time, and limits via query parameters.
- **Comprehensive Order Management**: Enables full lifecycle management of kitchen orders, including creation, updates, and cancellations.

## Use Cases

- **Restaurant Automation**: Integrate with POS systems to automate kitchen order processing.
- **Cloud Kitchens**: Manage multiple virtual kitchen operations efficiently.
- **Food Delivery Platforms**: Coordinate order preparation and delivery seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.
- **Flask-Smorest**: An extension for building REST APIs with Flask.
- **Marshmallow**: A library for object serialization and deserialization.
